A Two-Step Structural Model for the Collatz Contraction

Author: Amir Mohammad Shiravani (Raein)

Abstract

This paper explores the intrinsic structure of the Collatz transformation through a focused analysis of its two-step odd-even composite cycle. By defining Ts(n) = (3n + 1)/2 for odd n, the study examines the net growth factor (3/2 + 1/(2n)) and demonstrates how this formulation imposes a theoretical contraction trend on the overall system. Numerical simulations for n ≤ 10s confirm the average contraction behavior, supporting the heuristic argument for convergence in the Collatz map.

1. The Two-Step Odd–Even Transformation

The Collatz map T(n) = 3n + 1 transforms any odd integer into an even number, which is immediately halved in the following step. Combining these two operations yields the two-step map Ts(n) = (3n + 1)/2. The net growth factor is thus given by:

Ts(n)/n = (3n + 1)/(2n) = 3/2 + 1/(2n) For large n, this ratio approaches 1.5, implying that each odd-even cycle increases n by roughly 50%. Since subsequent divisions in even runs dominate this expansion, the long-term dynamic of the sequence is globally contracting.

3. Statistical Simulation and Observations

For numerical validation, Collatz sequences were simulated for integers n = 1 to 10s. Two primary metrics were extracted: (1) average stopping time σ(n) ≈ 85 steps, and (2) average number of odd steps ≈ 28 per sequence. The mean geometric step ratio was approximately 2.63, while the mean two-step cycle growth factor was ≈ 1.5. Because 1.5 < 2, the long-term process is statistically contracting on average.

4. Mathematical Implications

The form Ts(n)/n = 3/2 + 1/(2n) can be rewritten as Ts(n) = n * (3/2) + 1/2, a linear function with slope 1.5 and offset 0.5. Taking logarithms gives log(Ts(n)/n) ≈ log(1.5 + 1/(2n)), which converges to log(1.5) < log(2). Hence, the expected logarithmic growth over repeated applications decreases asymptotically, reinforcing contraction. This analysis provides a semi-analytical argument that the average drift of log(n) is negative under the Collatz iteration.

5. Conclusion and Future Work

The two-step transformation model Ts(n) = (3n + 1)/2 captures a key structural feature of the Collatz system. Its fixed average growth factor of approximately 1.5 serves as the foundation of a contracting dynamic that ultimately drives convergence. Future research should expand this analysis toward multi-step cycle compositions, explore modular invariants, and test contraction distributions on higher numerical scales to quantify long-term convergence behavior.
