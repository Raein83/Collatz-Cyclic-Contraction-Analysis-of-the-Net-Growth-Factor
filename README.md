# Collatz-Cyclic-Contraction-Analysis-of-the-Net-Growth-Factor
This paper introduces a novel growth factor model for the Collatz Conjecture, analyzing cyclic contraction behavior through the expression . It offers a fresh mathematical framework for understanding iterative dynamics in number theory.
