# Collatz-Cyclic-Contraction-Analysis-of-the-Net-Growth-Factor
This paper introduces a novel growth factor model for the Collatz Conjecture, analyzing cyclic contraction behavior through the expression . It offers a fresh mathematical framework for understanding iterative dynamics in number theory.
## 👹 The "Monster" Magnitude Stress Test
To demonstrate the structural robustness of the **Shiravani Model**, we examine the growth factor $G(n) = 1.5 + \frac{1}{2n}$ for magnitudes that exceed computable limits. At these scales, the "energy" for divergence vanishes.

| Monster Case | Magnitude ($n$) | Growth Factor $G(n)$ | Result |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Googolplex** | $10^{10^{100}}$ | $1.5 + \epsilon$ (where $\epsilon \to 0$) | **Locked at 1.5** |
| **Skewes' Number** | $e^{e^{e^{79}}}$ | $1.5 + 10^{-10^{10^{10}}}$ | **Deterministic 1.5** |
| **Graham's Number** | $G_{64}$ | $1.5 + \text{infinitesimal}$ | **Absolute Ceiling** |
| **TREE(3)** | Rapidly Growing Hier. | $1.5$ (Structural Identity) | **Collapse to 1** |

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **The Final Verdict:** Even for numbers far exceeding any computable magnitude—including Graham’s number and TREE(3)—the two-step Collatz growth factor collapses exactly to the deterministic ceiling $1.5$, rendering magnitude entirely irrelevant to the system’s global behavior.
